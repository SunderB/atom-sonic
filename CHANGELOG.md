# Releases of sunderb/sb-atom-sonic-pi
## 1.0 - First release of sunderb/sb-atom-sonic-pi
* Adjusted OSC code to send to Sonic Pi server, and optionally the Sonic Pi GUI (OSC messages sent to GUI appear in the cue log).
* Added save-and-play-file command, which saves the current file and tells Sonic Pi to play the file. This allows for playback of large buffers. This command can be activated using F5.
* Changed some key bindings (atom-sonic:stop used ctrl-s, which is used as save on many systems, so I changed that), see below for the key bindings.
